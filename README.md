# NoPixel Overlap Data
## Overview
This project was inspired by the [VisualizingTwitchCommunities](https://github.com/KiranGershenfeld/VisualizingTwitchCommunities) and [TwitchOverlap](https://github.com/snoww/TwitchOverlap) projects and attempts to create a similar network graph but instead of looking at the largest twitch streamers it looks at streamers in the NoPixel community.

## Data Collection
The list of channels to look at was compiled by looking at [HasRoot](https://nopixel.hasroot.com/serverInfo.php). The project only monitors streamers who have been active in the past 3 months. For each of those channels, if they are live, we query their list of chatters every 30m. At the end of the day all this data is aggregated into a daily file and at the end of the month these daily files are aggregated into a monthly file. At the end of the month we look at HasRoot activity data for the past month and filter the data to include just those channels.

## Dataset Explanation
### Nodes
The nodes file represents all of the channels with size representing the total number of chatters that have been in chat for the past month whenever the chat list was queried every 30m.
### Edges
The edges file represents chat overlap between two streamers.
###  Communities
The communities file was generated after importing the edge and nodes files into gephi and running modularity with a resolution of 0.25. Modifying the resolution will change the size of communities generated. The community number represents the community a channel was placed in signifying relevant overlap between their communities.

## Graph Generation
The graph file is generated by importing the nodes and edges to gephi, running modularity, force atlas, and label adjust.
